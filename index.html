  						 <p>Created to show off the talents of Grant Abbitt who has a great <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFUrFoqvqlN8seaAeEwjlw" target="_blank">Blender tutorial site on YouTube</a>.
							 
							 Grant provided me with his original .blend file which I modified slightly-mainly renaming his objects to better understand what was where.   
  							<p>The total file size is large due to the 2024x2024px images Grant used, but the .babylon file is ony 122kb (4365 vertices).

The starting model is a 3D scan courtesy of the <a href="http://lincoln3dscans.co.uk/sleeping-boy-2/" target="_blank">Usher Gallery, Lincoln (UK) and Oliver Laric.</a> The original model was triangulated and had 250,000+ vertices, but was converted to quads and reduced to 35,800+ vertices for display in a webpage using <a href="https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes" target="_blank">Instant Meshes</a>.
  							<p>A "dirty vertex" texture was created in Blender to emphasis the shading

  						 <p>This originally started out as a test for how the Blender Babylon Exporter(BBE) would handle a simple IK rig that had been attached to a rigged character created in <a href="http://www.makehuman.org/" target="_blank">MakeHuman</a>. However, after watching a video from a conference 
								in Paris (in French), it developed into something a little more humourous (hopefully). 
  							<p>The number of mesh deform bones was reduced to 26 - the added 8 IK bones, used to create the animation but do not deform the mesh directly, are not exported by the BBE
  							<p>Also a test of "Append" to add two different .babylon files to a single scene.</p>

  						 <p>My first major creation two months after beginning experimentation with Babylon.js. The original file size for the animated mesh was 7.05Mb but huge improvements to the Blender Exporter by <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/profile/8492-jcpalmer/" target="_blank">JCPalmer</a> have reduced the file size to 2.72Mb.</p> 
  							<p>The mesh was created with <a href="http://www.makehuman.org/" target="_blank">MakeHuman</a> and animated with the MalkWalk plugin for Blender. The animation itself is from The Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) BVH database available <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

  						 <p>In 2014 a book was published claiming to have identified "Jack the Ripper" as one Aaron Kosminski by analyzing the DNA found on a "shawl" alleged taken from the scene of the murder of Catherine Eddowes (4th Ripper Victim).</p> 
  							<p>The Eddowes connection to the "shawl" is based on a claim that the DNA shows a sequence mutation which is described as "314.1C". Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, the forensic scientist who invented DNA fingerprinting, describes this as an 
								"error in nomenclature" for the very common sequence variation 315.1C. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Kosminski#DNA_evidence" target="_blank">Wikipedia : Aaron Kosminski</a></p>
  							<p>The animated model shows how the end result for a mutation at 314 or 315 would be chemically identical.</p>

  						 <p>The original Blender file for this old house comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u1PSx9CcSM" target="_blank">tutorials</a> by Michael McCann of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Wayward-Art-Co-371287396388453/" target="_blank">Wayward Art Co</a>. The modelling techniques used for the house are very good.</p> 
				<p>Michael provided the Blender file and gave permission to use his model as a test of BJS. The original model I got from Michael has 4 textures for the house - diffuse, normal, specular, and shadow. However, each texture is extremely large (5000+ x 5000+) - a massive browser download.</p> 
				<p> So for this test the model was modified in Blender to use only a diffuse texture (2048x2048) with baked in shadows </p>

  						 <p>This little demo started out as looking like a simple task but it turns out that creating maps for these old globes was quite a complex business and the skills of the old globe makers is impressive</p>
								<p> The globe makers created strips of textures called "gores" which were then glued onto a sphere. No NASA maps back then !! </p>
								<p>I used map parts available at the <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/xmaps10001.html" target="_blank">David Rumsey Map Collection</a> available under this <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/" target="_blank">CC licence (No Commercial Use)</a> to create the final map.  You can see the 12 "gores" (segments) at the map link.</p>
